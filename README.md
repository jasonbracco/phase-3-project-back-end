Description:
As a former/current shoe collector, I know it can be hard to track all of your purchases.  Wouldn't it be easy to just enter in your new pickups into a form and have it populate for you?  Well, you're in luck!  This program will allow you to keep track of all your new, old, and upcoming favorite kicks.

Installation:
You will need NPM, ActiveRecord, and Ruby installed in order to utilize this program

Usage:
The front and back end of this program are under the phase-3-project-back-end repo.  Fork and clone that repo, and then you can run the following to access the React and Ruby portions:

Back end: cd Project-Server
Front end: cd Project-Client

The program also has seed data, so feel free to run rake db:seed if you wish to see how the program will track your shoes.
